 <h2> About Fortnite</h2>
  <p> Fortnite is a battle royale, pvp game by Epic Games. The game starts with 100 people, and if your the last person standing, you win the game. There's multiple game modes you can play (builds or no builds) but I've been enjoying no builds since it's very fun in my opinion. There's also the mode Arena which is the competitive mode for fortnite with their being 3 different leagues: open, contedner, and champion divison (currently i'm champion divison). If you're gonna play fortnite for fun, try out zero builds, but if you're playing fortnite competitivley, try out the arena modes. </p>

  <h2> About Call of Duty</h2>
  <p> Call of Duty is a First Person shooter game that usually have a good multiplayer, but decent campaign (single player mode). Single player mode (AKA campaign) is where it's usually you against bots in the game and there's usually 4 difficulties (easy, nomral, hard, and veteran) which easy being the easiest and veteran being the hardest. Most campaigns take about 18 hours to complete, but they are always fun to play when you are bored of Multiplayer, which is our next topic. The multiplayer in CoD is always fun. There's a few modes you can play: Team deathmatch, search and destroy, reinforce, and many more. Usually all the multiplayer modes require more than one person, so if you want to play multiplayer, get your friends to hop on and start playing. </p>

  <h2> About Rainbow Six</h2>
  <p> Rainbow six is a first person shooter made by Ubisoft. There are a bunch of rainbow six games (Rainbow six vegas 1-2, rainbow six siege, rainbow six extraction, and many more). I mainly play Rainbow six siege. The game is a 5v5 multiplayer casual and ranked multiplayer with it being multiplayer, you can either solo queue or play with 5 people (RECCOMENDED TO PLAY RANKED WITH 5 PEOPLE). To reach the ranked mode, you have to reach level 50 (so a small grind). The ranks are copper, brone, silver, gold, platnium, diamond, and champion (I am currently a platnium player). There are a lot of things to learn in the game, mainly callouts and mechanics. The more of the game you play, the better you get with the mechanics and callouts.</p>
